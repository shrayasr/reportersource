			<h2>The ability to connect news / media reporters to the right sources and experts in a domain is hard. A reporter works on tight deadlines and is expected to come up with a new story and a brand new perspective on issues that cannot be predicted. <span>Reportersource</span> aims to create a platform to bridge the gap between a news source and a reporter. We are a team with a senior correspondent who has worked in a National Channel for 3 years and he has faced this problem. The US already has a platform and it has become so big that they have also moved to the UK now; but such a platform does not exist in India. We at <span>Reportersource</span> intend to connect the power brokers of the country to the wonderful expertise that our India has.</h2>
